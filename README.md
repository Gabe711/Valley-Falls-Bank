# ValleyFallsBank
In a group project my team and I created A web-based banking application that has all the functionalities of a normal banking website. A user can sign up, open accounts, transfer money between accounts, deposit, withdraw, and more. An Admin has additional funcitonalities outside of the ones a user has such as the ability to see transaction history and delete accounts.

<h1>What I learned:</h1>
SQL for our database
HTML/CSS for the front-end
PHP to help connect the front-end and backend
Xampp to manage our database
